## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​I have one profile picture that is on the home page. The biography is still a work in progress, but it does have a Latin words placeholder...!! The Contact Form is functional, and has been tested by multiple people across different networks and devices. The Projects section is called "My Portfolio", which will be updated as we complete the different modules. The external links are at the bottom of each page, and include my Facebook page, my GitHub page and our pony stud website. I wanted clean aesthetics with limited scrolling, preferring to split up the different areas using pages.

### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.
My website contains a home page, and 3 additional pages. The home page can be accessed by clicking the ES logo on the top left from any of the other pages. The website is responsive, with the menu becoming a hamburger icon on mobile, and remaining on the top right of the screen when scrolling down (as required). All links are functional and use the same terminology on the home page as in the menu, as well as the heading on the respective pages once clicked.

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
